          <p>This course is suitable for those who wish to further develop their careers in the IT industry. Work based
            learning elements are key throughout your studies on the FdSc and, therefore, it is ideal for either
            full-time or part-time study alongside an existing IT position. The foundation degree was created by
            consulting with local employers such as BGL Group (Compare the Market) to ensure the course meets their
            needs and ensures graduates have the skills required for industry.</p>

          <p>Computing is changing our world by the way we work and the way we live. To study computer science is to put
            you at the forefront not just of technological change, but of social change too. This course studies the
            principles and technologies underpinning the systems that are driving this change.</p>

          <p>You will study a number of modules designed to promote your professional growth and personal development
            whilst providing an opportunity to build upon these directly through a combination of work- based learning
            projects and traditional classroom based study. During your studies you will be encouraged to acquire key
            practical skills to help you build specialist knowledge within computing.</p>

          <p>The field of computing offers a wealth of opportunities across a range of specialist fields and the variety
            of course options on offer means that you can fine-tune your degree to focus on particular areas of interest
            or to meet the requirements of a favoured career.</p>

          <p>Employability is a key focus with guest speakers from industry, real case studies, vocational assignment
            scenarios and modules that have been developed alongside employers. Work-based learning modules will
            encourage you to reflect on and further develop the professional skills gained in the work place. Students
            also take part the Global Day of Code and Agile Peterborough events, along with regular sessions for meeting
            professionals and build working relationships.</p>

          <p>The courses at University Centre Peterborough are studied in smaller class sizes compared with other
            universities, a typical class size is under 30 students.</p>

          <p>If studying full-time you will be in classes, seminars and tutorials for approximately 15 hours per week
            and will spend the rest of your time in independent study and extra-curricular activities including work
            placement if not embedded in your course. We recommend that full-time students allow an additional 30 hours

            teaching at University Centre Peterborough since September 2009 on modules including Programming Concepts,
            Digital Asset Development and Developing Interactive Web Solutions.</p>

          <p>I have held industry positions as a Software Developer producing bespoke systems for the supply chain
            industry, working to develop custom solutions for various departments. From 2003 to 2007, I worked as a

          <p>I have also worked in the Canadian media industry as an Animator and Film Editor on various projects for
            television and independent films. During this period, I worked with NISH media to animate and combine live

            for complex movie previsualisations.</p>

          <p>I am interested in Video Game Design and Development, having produced a number of independent games over
            that last 15 years and winning an award for Educational Video Game Design in 2010. More recently my focus
            has been on developing the Computing and Information Systems degree, working with the local computing
