          <p>What sets this course apart is its flexibility - with 16 optional modules to choose from in years 2 and 3.
            It is ideal if you are looking for a wide range of computing skills: from web design and development with
            PHP and JavaScript, computer programming in languages such as C# and Python, mobile app coding in Java, and
            embedded systems with C++. You will develop skills in cyber security, database management and CISCO network
            systems support, and have the option to study specialised subjects such as AI with Machine Learning and Big
            Data. We will help you develop a systematic, creative and flexible approach to problem solving that
            computing professionals rely on.</p>

          <p>The course is designed with modules to promote your professional growth and personal development. You will
            be encouraged to acquire key practical skills to help you build a broad base and deep knowledge of
            computing. This will allow you to make informed choices when developing specialist in-depth knowledge in
            your preferred areas.</p>

          <p>Employability is a key focus with guest speakers from industry, practical case studies, vocational
            assignment scenarios and modules which have been developed alongside employers. We encourage entrepreneurs
            and will provide you with the opportunity to gain the knowledge necessary to develop your own business ideas
            around the latest technical innovations. Students also take part in the Global Day of Code and Agile
            Peterborough events, along with regular sessions for meeting professionals and build working relationships.
          </p>

          <p>The Major Project is your chance to develop expertise in a subject of your choice, which can form the
            centre-piece for your portfolio ready for future interviews. You will have the opportunity to demonstrate
            this work to industry professionals at our annual exhibition of final year projects. Examples of previous
            projects include VR computer games, specialised applications of Drones and Raspberry Pi based systems such
            as digital weather stations and in-car diagnostic dashboards.</p>

          <p>The courses at University Centre Peterborough are studied in smaller class sizes compared with other
