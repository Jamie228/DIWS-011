                            <p>Database development is fundamental in the area of computing and IT within organisational
                                contexts. Database Management Systems (DBMS) provide the systems, tools and interfaces
                                by which the organisation can manage their information and use it to assist in the
                                effective running of the organisation. Databases offer many links to other areas such as
                                programming, systems analysis, HCI, as well as embracing issues of compatibility and
                                end-user interfacing.</p>
                            <p>This module builds on the fundamentals of database design from Level 4 giving students
                                opportunities to develop an understanding of the concepts and issues relating to
                                databases and database design as well as the practical skills to translate that
                                understanding into the design and creation of complex databases.</p>
                            <p>The students develop advanced design concepts based on Entity Relationship Diagrams and
                                apply these to real-world cases. They also develop their knowledge of SQL beyond basic
                                queries by adding techniques such as outer joins, aggregation and DDL. The students
                                experience the multi-user aspect of databases by working with transactions.</p>

                            <p>Object oriented programming is a programming language model organised around objects
                                rather than actions and data rather than logic. Industry dictates that the reuse of code
                                is a fundamental skill required of graduates as this leads to cleaner, more robust code.
                                Object Oriented programming also facilitates the generation of Test Driven Development.
