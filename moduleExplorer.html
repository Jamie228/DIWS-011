                            <p>Database development is fundamental in the area of computing and IT within organisational
                                contexts. Database Management Systems (DBMS) provide the systems, tools and interfaces
                                by which the organisation can manage their information and use it to assist in the
                                effective running of the organisation. Databases offer many links to other areas such as
                                programming, systems analysis, HCI, as well as embracing issues of compatibility and
                                end-user interfacing.</p>
                            <p>This module builds on the fundamentals of database design from Level 4 giving students
                                opportunities to develop an understanding of the concepts and issues relating to
                                databases and database design as well as the practical skills to translate that
                                understanding into the design and creation of complex databases.</p>
                            <p>The students develop advanced design concepts based on Entity Relationship Diagrams and
                                apply these to real-world cases. They also develop their knowledge of SQL beyond basic
                                queries by adding techniques such as outer joins, aggregation and DDL. The students
                                experience the multi-user aspect of databases by working with transactions.</p>

                            <p>Object oriented programming is a programming language model organised around objects
                                rather than actions and data rather than logic. Industry dictates that the reuse of code
                                is a fundamental skill required of graduates as this leads to cleaner, more robust code.
                                Object Oriented programming also facilitates the generation of Test Driven Development.

                            <p>This module builds on the key concepts of network switching and routing by focusing on
                                routing protocols and some of the
                                more advanced elements of network device configuration.</p>
                            <p>This module introduces the learner to static and dynamic routing theory and the protocols

                                technology. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) will be used to create a routed network and
                                further security features such as
                                Access Control Lists (ACL) will be presented. Network addressing features such as
                                Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
                                (DHCP) and Network Address Translation (NAT) are finally implemented to complete the

                                through a series of guided laboratory exercises. In the lab sessions students will gain
                                a deep understanding on the routing and
                                switching concepts and acquire hands-on-skills using advanced network simulation tools
                                that comply with industry standard

                            <p>Design patterns are commonly defined as time-tested solutions to recurring design
                                problems. The term refers to both the
                                description of a solution that you can read, and an instance of that solution as used to
                                solve a particular problem.</p>
                            <p>Students will be introduced to not only what design patterns are but how and why their

                                languages access a database via SQL statements embedded in appropriate pages. It is
                                expected that students will have a
                                thorough knowledge of HTML, CSS and Scripting languages before beginning this module.

                                the pages is user centered. It is considered essential that the student understands the
                                necessity for a web site, whether it is on
                                the Internet or Intranet, to be usable by its clients both internal and external.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, the student is required to produce documentation that fully describes the
                                web site such that others can easily
                                make future revisions. In order to understand the design of client / server web site it
                                is necessary that the student researches
                                current design standards and existing related web sites.</p>

                                subjects. It takes its inspiration from human and other biological behaviour that
                                exhibit intelligence, such as problem solving,
                                planning, decision making and optimization, and seeks to create systems that can perform
                                similar intelligent tasks.</p>
                            <p>The students will explore the main areas of AI such as behaviour, genetic algorithms,
                                neural networks and fuzzy logic. The
                                module is quite practical with an emphasis on implementing techniques in code. Some
                                topics will extend over several weeks

                            <p>This module is based on the CCNA 4 element of the Cisco Routing & Switching curriculum.
                                It builds on the Network Scaling
                                Module by focusing on the Wide Area Network (WAN) technologies and network services
                                required by converged applications
                                in a complex network. In this module the student will learn about the selection criteria
                                of network devices and WAN
                                technologies to meet network requirements.</p>
                            <p>The course will investigate different WAN technologies and their benefits as well as the
                                operations and benefits of virtual
                                private networks (VPNs) and tunnelling. The student will learn how to configure and
                                troubleshoot both serial and broadband
                                connections.</p>
                            <p>This module will also explore IPsec tunnelling operations as well as monitoring and
                                troubleshooting network operations using
                                analytical tools such as syslog, SNMP, and NetFlow.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the module the student will be able to configure and troubleshoot network
                                devices and resolve common issues
                                with data link protocols. Students will also develop the knowledge and skills needed to
                                implement IPsec and Virtual Private
                                Network (VPN) operations in a complex network.</p>
